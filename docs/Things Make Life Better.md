## Chrome Extension

2. OneTab

  > 当您发现自己有太多的标签页时，单击OneTab图标，将所有标签页转换成一个列表。当您需要再次访问这些标签页时，可以单独或全部恢复它们。当您的标签页位于OneTab列表时，您将节省高达95％的内存，因为你将减少Google Chrome浏览器中打开的标签页的数量。

3. Papier

  > Did you know that the average person has about 60,000 thoughts a day? And that we spend about 7 hours looking at screens? Now with the Papier extension for Chrome, just open a new tab and trap your best thoughts. They'll be backed up directly to Chrome: no accounts, no syncing. 
  
4. the great suspender

  > Unload, park, suspend tabs to reduce memory footprint of chrome.
